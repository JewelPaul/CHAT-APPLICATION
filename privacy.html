                <p><strong>Student Project Disclosure:</strong> ChatWave is an academic project developed as part of the CODTECH PROJECTS internship program. This privacy policy outlines our approach to data handling in this educational context. The application is designed with privacy in mind and minimizes data collection by design.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ChatWave ("we," "our," or "us"). Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our ChatWave application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Educational Context</h2>
            <p>ChatWave was developed as an academic project to demonstrate proficiency in web development, real-time communication technologies, and user interface design. As an educational project:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The application is designed to minimize data collection</li>
                <li>No user registration or account creation is required</li>
                <li>Messages are not stored on any server</li>
                <li>All communication is peer-to-peer and encrypted</li>
                <li>The project is not intended for commercial use</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Our approach to data collection is minimalistic by design. We collect very limited information:</p>

            <h3>3.1 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <p>When you use our Service, we may automatically collect certain information about your device, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We detect your device type to generate a device name (e.g., "Windows PC," "iPhone") which is used as an identifier in the chat interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> Basic browser capabilities are detected to ensure compatibility with the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information on how you interact with the Service, such as the features you use and the time spent on the Service.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This information is collected solely within your browser and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Information You Provide</h3>
            <p>You may voluntarily provide certain information when using the Service:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profile Images:</strong> If you choose to upload a profile image, this image is stored locally in your browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Messages:</strong> The content of messages you send through the Service. These messages are transmitted directly to the recipient and are not stored on any server.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Codes:</strong> Unique codes generated for establishing connections with other users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>To maintain your privacy, we do not collect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email address, phone number, etc.)</li>
                <li>Payment information</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Message history or content</li>
                <li>Contact lists or social connections</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The limited information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We use device information to ensure the Service functions properly on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>To Facilitate Communication:</strong> We use connection codes to establish peer-to-peer connections between users.</li>
                <li><strong>To Improve the Service:</strong> We may use usage data to understand how users interact with the Service and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>To Personalize User Experience:</strong> We use device information to provide a personalized identifier in the chat interface.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>ChatWave is designed with a focus on privacy and security:</p>

            <h3>5.1 Local Storage</h3>
            <p>All user data is stored locally in your browser using standard web storage technologies (localStorage). This includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your unique connection code</li>
                <li>Your device name</li>
                <li>Your profile image (if uploaded)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Message Encryption</h3>
            <p>All messages sent through the Service are encrypted using AES encryption. The encryption keys are generated locally and exchanged directly between users during the connection process. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the messages.</p>

            <h3>5.3 No Server Storage</h3>
            <p>ChatWave operates on a peer-to-peer model. Messages are transmitted directly between users and are not stored on any server. Once a message is delivered to the recipient, we have no access to its content.</p>

            <h3>5.4 Security Measures</h3>
            <p>While we implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <div class="privacy-highlight">
                <p><strong>Educational Project Limitation:</strong> As this is a student project, the security measures implemented may not be as robust as those in commercial applications. Users should exercise caution when sharing sensitive information.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. The only data sharing that occurs is the direct peer-to-peer exchange of encrypted messages between users of the Service.</p>

            <p>We may disclose your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> If we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Evaluation:</strong> As this is a student project, anonymized usage statistics may be shared for academic evaluation purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Your Data Rights</h2>
            <p>As a user of ChatWave, you have certain rights regarding your data:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access all your data directly through your browser's developer tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can clear your data by clearing your browser's localStorage or by using the browser's "Clear browsing data" function.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Since all data is stored locally, you already have full access to your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You can choose not to provide certain information, although this may limit your ability to use certain features of the Service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

            <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain links to or integrate with third-party websites, services, or applications that are not operated by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party services.</p>

            <p>We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit or service you use.</p>

            <h2>11. Analytics and Cookies</h2>
            <p>ChatWave does not use cookies or third-party analytics services. We do not track your browsing activity across other websites or services.</p>

            <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>As all data is stored locally on your device and peer-to-peer communications are direct between users, there are no international data transfers conducted by the Service itself.</p>

            <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us through the GitHub profile (JewelPaul) linked in the Contact page or via Instagram (pauljewel25). As this is a student project, please understand that responses may not be immediate.</p>

            <h2>14. Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICE.</p>

            <div class="privacy-highlight">
                <p><strong>Final Educational Disclosure:</strong> ChatWave was created as an educational project to demonstrate technical skills in web development and real-time communication. The application prioritizes privacy by design, minimizing data collection and implementing end-to-end encryption. However, as a student project, it may not have undergone the same rigorous security testing as commercial applications.</p>
