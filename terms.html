            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to ChatWave ("we," "our," or "us"). ChatWave is an academic project developed as part of the CODTECH PROJECTS internship program. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ChatWave application, website, and services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

            <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> ChatWave is a student project created for educational purposes. It is not intended for commercial use or to handle sensitive communications. The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.</p>

            <h2>2. Educational Purpose</h2>
            <p>ChatWave was developed as an academic exercise to demonstrate proficiency in web development, real-time communication technologies, and user interface design. The primary purpose of this project is educational, serving as:</p>

                <li>A demonstration of technical skills for academic evaluation</li>
                <li>A portfolio piece for the student developer</li>
                <li>A practical application of web development concepts</li>
                <li>A learning tool for understanding real-time communication protocols</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Users should understand that this application was not developed with commercial intent and may not have the same level of features, security, or reliability as commercial chat applications.</p>

            <h2>4. User Accounts and Communication</h2>
